# Mario
A remake of the original Super Mario Bros. on NES

This is one of the first projects I made. I decided I wanted a challenge, so I started working on this. It is not very efficient, but it works, and you can make custom levels using the level editor. Instructions for how the levels can/should be made are in leveleditor.txt

I do not own any of the sprites or sounds used in this project
